# artillery-load-testing

This is an application built for Iceland by myself to solve an ongoing issue with an inhouse application.

The app was created to load test applications and routes to investigate if concurrent users would cause memory caching issues.

This was a solo project guided and developed by me, the application had to navigate through security software and protocols programmed and debugged by myself.

Details, routes, and keys have been removed due to security reasons.

The app creates virtual users that are imported via CSV from another in house application, which then iterates down the scenario list performing actions as guided by the scripts.
functions.js does most of the heavy lifting in the application as this processes and harvests required data.

JavaScript is my native programming Language and was chosen for time restraints.
